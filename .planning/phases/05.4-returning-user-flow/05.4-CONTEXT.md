# Phase 5.4: Returning User Flow - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When a returning user (with saved role + company size) starts a new consultation, they skip steps 1-2 and land directly on topic selection (step 3).

The step progress indicator shows their previously selected values next to each step number — e.g., "Step 1: Darbdavys", "Step 2: 10-50". These previous steps are clickable, allowing the user to navigate back and change their selection just like a new user would.

If the user changes their role or company size, that new selection is saved to their profile and becomes their default for future consultations.

First-time users (no saved profile) continue to see all 3 steps as before.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Speed** — Returning users get to topic selection instantly, no friction
- **Context awareness** — User always sees what profile is being used for this consultation
- **Easy editing** — Changing role/company should be obvious and effortless (clickable steps)

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Step progress shows selected value inline: "Step 1: Darbdavys" not just "Step 1"
- Clicking a completed step navigates back to re-select (same UX as new user flow)
- Changes to role/company always update Firestore profile (no "save as default?" prompts)
- Detect saved profile on page load, skip to step 3 if complete

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This builds on the existing 3-step onboarding flow on the homepage. The step progress UI already exists — this phase enhances it to show selected values and enable click-to-edit for returning users.

Profile data is stored in Firestore under the user document (implemented in Phase 5).
